###### Reference:

- **`User Story`**: The smallest decomposition of an effort or requirement that is part of a larger epic
- **`As a`**: type of user | user type | role | group of users
- **`I/We want`**:  A task's goal | outcome | benefit | {disbenefit to be avoided}
- **`So That / Because`**:  The reason | why this is needed/desired.

###### Method

- A User story must/should be atomic and non-decomposable as possible, i.e. a simple statement.
- Story should describe a need that can be satisfied by introducing a new feature or
changing an existing feature.
- Stories identify what someone wants to accomplish with your product and why.
- `Story splitting` is the practice of breaking big pieces of work down into smaller, deliverable
pieces of work.
